# Network Administration & Labs

### About this Repository

This repository showcases my hands-on experience in various aspects of network administration, including **Cisco switch and router configuration**, **VLANs for network segmentation**, and comprehensive **firewall rule management** utilizing powerful tools like **pfSense** and **Suricata**. Through a series of practical projects, this collection provides detailed insights into my ability to effectively set up, secure, troubleshoot, and optimize diverse network infrastructures, ensuring robust and efficient connectivity.

### Projects - (Markdown Write-ups Coming Soon)

* [**Essential Switch Configuration:**](https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/01-Essential-Switch-Configuration) Configured and verified switch and PC settings in Cisco Packet Tracer to establish basic network connectivity, secure communications, and test functionality for a small LAN. 

* [**Switch Port Security Configuration:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/02-Switch-Port-Security-Configuration) Configured and tested port security on a Cisco switch in Cisco Packet Tracer, populating MAC address tables, applying policies, and validating against violations. 

* [**Initial Router Configuration:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/03-Initial-Router-Configuration) Practiced initial router setup in Cisco Packet Tracer, connecting devices, assigning IP addresses, and ensuring fundamental connectivity.

* [**Configuring Static Routes:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/04-Configuring-Static-Routes) Configured IPv4 static routes on Cisco routers, establishing network connectivity between three LANs and an external network through manual routing table setup.

* [**Configuring VLANs and Trunks:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/05-Configuring-VLANs-and-Trunks) Configured Virtual Local Area Networks (VLANs) and trunking on Cisco switches to segment networks for improved performance, enhanced security, and streamlined management. **(In Progress - Aug. 30th, 2025)**

* [**Implementing Access Control Lists:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/06-Implementing-Access-Control-Lists) Enhanced network security by implementing and verifying standard and extended Access Control Lists (ACLs) on Cisco routers to filter traffic based on IP addresses.

* [**Configuring Static, Dynamic, and Overload NAT:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/07-Configuring-Static-Dynamic-Overload-NAT) Configured and verified Static, Dynamic, and Overload Network Address Translation (NAT/PAT) on Cisco routers for IP address management and private-to-external network communication.

* [**PFSense Firewall Rule Configuration:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/08-PFSense-Firewall-Rule-Configuration) Gained practical firewall management skills by applying rules to control network traffic, specifically ICMP, via the pfSense web interface in a simulated environment.

* [**Suricata Installation and Rule Configuration on PFSense:**](https://www.google.com/search?q=https://github.com/iagsalazar1-cs/Network-Administration-and-Labs/tree/main/09-Suricata-Installation-and-Rule-Configuration-on-PFSense) Installed and configured Suricata (Intrusion Detection System/Intrusion Prevention System) on a pfSense firewall, exploring network traffic monitoring, security, and threat protection through rule sets and alert analysis.
