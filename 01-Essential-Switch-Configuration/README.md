# Essential Switch Configuration in Packet Tracer (In Progress...)

### Overview

This project focuses on configuring and verifying switch and PC settings within **Cisco Packet Tracer** to establish basic network connectivity. The tasks involve setting up communication between endpoints, configuring network security settings, and testing connectivity. The network for this project consists of a Local Area Network (LAN) with a switch (`S1-Floor1`) connecting two PCs: `John's PC` and `Micky's PC`. An `Admin PC` is also present, used for configuration but not directly connected to the switch's network ports.

### Goals

1. Connect to a **Cisco switch** using the console port.

2. Navigate the **Cisco IOS CLI**, including user `EXEC` mode, privileged `EXEC` mode, and global configuration mode.

3. Configure basic switch settings, including the hostname, system time, user accounts, and passwords.

4. Secure switch access by configuring console authentication and encrypting passwords.

5. Configure `IP addresses` on PCs and verify network connectivity between them.

6. Display and interpret switch interface information.

7. Examine the switch's `MAC` address table and save switch configurations.

### Project Tasks

* **Task 1:** Connect to the Switch, Explore `CLI` Modes, and Set System Time: Connect `Admin PC` to switch console, explore user `EXEC` mode, enter privileged `EXEC`, set switch time.

* **Task 2:** Enter Global Configuration Mode, Set Hostname, and Configure User and Privileged `EXEC` Passwords: Enter global configuration, set hostname, configure user and privileged `EXEC` passwords.

* **Task 3:** Configure Switch Security: set `MOTD` banner, configure console authentication.

* **Task 4:** Encrypt and Save Configurations: Exit console configuration, encrypt passwords, save configurations.

* **Task 5:** Configure and Verify PC `IP Addresses`: Configure `John's` and `Micky's` PCs with `IP addresses`/subnet masks; verify connectivity.

* **Task 6:** Display Switch Information: Display `FastEthernet0/1` interface info and `MAC` address table.

* **Task 7:** Display Running Configuration: Display switch's running configuration.
